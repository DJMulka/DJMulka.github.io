                <p>
                    LightGuide Copilot is an AI-powered assistant developed to improve the quality, consistency, and
                    scalability of
                    augmented reality work instructions authored in the LightGuide platform. Installed alongside the
                    core AR software,
                    Copilot analyzes workflows against a defined set of standards, flags deviations, and provides
                    actionable feedback to
                    help users improve their authoring practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently in active development, the first phase focuses on auditing and grading authored workflows
                    based on custom rule
                    sets. Users receive test results, scores, and detailed suggestions for improving their instructions.
                    The long-term
                    vision includes integrating a fine-tuned language model that can generate AR workflows from natural
                    language
                    descriptions, paving the way for AI-assisted authoring at scale.

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Automated Workflow Review & Scoring:</strong> Analyzes AR workflows to detect non-compliant
                    elements based on defined authoring standards, then generates a score to
                    reflect adherence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Detailed Feedback System:</strong> Flags individual test failures and provides step-by-step
                    suggestions for improving the instruction set to meet internal
                    best practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Authoring Standards Engine:</strong> Enforces consistency across work instructions authored
                    by different users, making it easier to support large-scale,
                    multi-site deployments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Future-Ready AI Integration Path:</strong> Designed with forward compatibility for
                    integrating LLMs to support natural language-to-workflow generation in future
                    phases.

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    LightGuide Copilot is still in its early stages, but it's built with a forward-looking architecture
                    designed to evolve
                    alongside the growing complexity of AR authoring needs. The current rule-based system for enforcing
                    authoring standards
                    lays the foundation for several key expansion paths:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>AI-Powered Workflow Generation:</strong> Future versions will integrate a fine-tuned
                    language model capable of generating entire AR workflows from natural
                    language descriptions. Users will be able to describe a manufacturing process in plain English, and
                    Copilot will
                    translate that into a functional, standards-compliant instruction set, dramatically reducing
                    authoring time and barriers
                    to entry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Customizable Standards for Enterprise Teams:</strong> As deployment scales to more
                    industries and customers, Copilot will support custom rule sets tailored to specific
                    company standards, giving enterprise users control over how quality is defined and enforced within
                    their workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Adaptive Authoring Recommendations:</strong> By analyzing usage patterns, success rates, and
                    revision histories, Copilot can begin offering context-aware suggestions
                    during workflow creation. This shifts the assistant from reactive to proactive, guiding users
                    toward best practices in real time.
