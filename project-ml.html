                    This is a system that I developed for an aerospace customer that needed help reducing errors in
                    prepacked kits
                    of assembly hardware. Kits were arriving at the factory with wrong quantities, wrong parts or
                    missing parts all together.
                    This system addresses their needs by providing augmented reality based guidance to indicate which
                    parts to pick.
                    This system also validates the correct picks were made by using a computer vision camera to take a
                    snapshot of the presented parts and identify them with a machine learning model.

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Machine-Learning Part Identification:</strong> On prem deployed Machine-Learning model
                    validated that the correct part and quantity was selected by the operator
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Augmented Reality Kitting Guidance:</strong> Projected light guides the user to select parts
                    from the appropriate bins ensuring the correct part is chosen
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Label Printer & Barcode Scanner Integration:</strong> Part bag labels and kit labels are
                    automatically generated and printed by using data from the plant management system to automate the
                    kitting process

                <p>
                    The deployment of this system delivered significant improvements including:
                </p>
                <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>32% reduction in time to assemble kits</li>
                    <li>0 defects achieved across thousands of delivered kits using no fault forward approach</li>
                    <li>Ability to have even untrained operators pack kits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This system has been running successfully on-site since April of 2023.

                <h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge: </strong> Kits being delivered with the wrong parts and quantities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Use a trained machine learning model to properly identify and count the
                    correct number of parts have been picked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge: </strong> Incorrect parts were ending up in bins labeled for other parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Operators would scan a barcode for the part they wanted to restock and
                    the system would use augmented reality guidance to highlight the correct bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Manufacturing site cannot run a cloud based model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Train a model on the cloud and deploy it locally in the manufacturing
                    site.
