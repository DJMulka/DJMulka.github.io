                    This system was developed for an aerospace customer facing frequent errors in prepacked hardware
                    kits, ranging from
                    incorrect quantities to missing or misplaced components. To address these challenges, I created a
                    connected, augmented
                    reality-driven solution that ensures accuracy and traceability throughout the kitting process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system provides real-time AR guidance, visually directing operators to the correct components
                    using a dynamic
                    display interface. To validate each pick, an integrated computer vision system captures an image of
                    the presented parts
                    and uses a machine learning model to automatically identify and verify them. This advanced sensing
                    layer adds an
                    additional safeguard against human error without slowing down the workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By combining AR interaction, intelligent perception, and MES integration, the solution delivers a
                    high level of
                    precision and accountability, dramatically reducing rework, improving kit integrity, and supporting
                    quality-critical
                    aerospace operations.

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Machine-Learning Part Identification:</strong> A high-resolution camera captures images of
                    selected parts, which are then analyzed using a custom-trained machine
                    learning model to verify correctness in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Augmented Reality Pick Guidance:</strong> Operators are visually directed through the
                    kitting process using an AR interface that highlights the correct
                    components, reducing reliance on paper instructions and minimizing confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Connected System Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrates with the customer's plant
                    management system to pull live kit data and push validation
                    results, ensuring full traceability and process alignment. Part and kit labels are automatically
                    generated and printed to automate the kitting process
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Results &amp; Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    The deployment of this system delivered significant improvements including:

                <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>32% reduction in time to assemble kits</li>
                    <li>0 defects achieved across thousands of delivered kits using no fault forward approach</li>
                    <li>Ability to have even untrained operators pack kits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This system has been running successfully on-site since April of 2023.

                <h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge: </strong> Kits being delivered with the wrong parts and quantities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Use a trained machine learning model to properly identify and count the
                    correct number of parts have been picked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge: </strong> Incorrect parts were ending up in bins labeled for other parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Operators would scan a barcode for the part they wanted to restock and
                    the system would use augmented reality guidance to highlight the correct bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Manufacturing site cannot run a cloud based model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Train a model on the cloud and deploy it locally in the manufacturing
                    site.
